# Choose your own adventure game

A woman begins her freshman year of university. Mostly everything has been perfect so far; she graduated highschool with strong grades, scholarships, got into her dream university in engineering (well she wanted computer science, but she could transfer later), has multiple friends to support her, a caring boyfriend....nothing could be better.

Or so she thought.

Upon entering university, everything changed; her friends are on the other half of the country, she lives alone in a dorm with no other connections, the pressure of an engineering degree is catching up to her. The worst of all? Her famous fairytale relationship with her boyfriend is reaching the end of the story...and its not a traditional "happily-ever-after" scenario either. 

Shes now all alone in a new world, just like how she started in highschool. Only this time her experience is going to be very much different. She could make friends, enemies, lovers...the possibilities are endless with the choices you make.

## 10s MODE (maybe not):
A young girl has the choice to see the future or the past. she enters the mirror and based on her life choices premade before  entering she will get sent back to the past or to the future.
if she chooses the future, she goes to a version when shes entering highschool (2020's) she sees everyone grown up and 
changed, and she gets judged for how she looks, how she acts, etc. She either changes herself or others.
if she goes to the past, she goes back to a time when her mom was her age (1977). the two can either be best friends, neutral partners or enemies. this relationship is important because whatever happens will effect herself>
