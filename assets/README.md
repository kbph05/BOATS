# BOATS

A woman begins her freshman year of university. Mostly everything has been perfect so far; she graduated highschool with strong grades, scholarships, got into her dream university in engineering (well she wanted computer science, but she could transfer later), has multiple friends to support her, a caring boyfriend....nothing could be better.

Or so she thought.

Upon entering university, everything changed; her friends are on the other half of the country, she lives alone in a dorm with no other connections, the pressure of an engineering degree is catching up to her. The worst of all? Her famous fairytale relationship with her boyfriend is reaching the end of the story...and its not a traditional "happily-ever-after" scenario either. 

Sh's now on her own in a new chapter of her life, just like how she started in highschool. Only this time her experience is going to be much different. She could make friends, enemies, lovers...the possibilities are endless with the choices you make.
